**An open-source AI agent that runs on your machine, works for hours, and won't blow your budget.**

Hand Maverick a goal. Its orchestrator decomposes it, spawns specialist sub-agents — researcher, coder, writer, verifier — that work in parallel, checks their output, and returns a result. Every step runs under a hard spending cap and through a safety layer, on the models *you* choose.

- 🧠 **Long-horizon swarm.** Recursive multi-agent coordination built for hours-long tasks, not one-shot replies.
- 🛡️ **Safe by default.** Agent Shield screens every prompt, tool call, and output — the full SDK scores F1 0.988 on prompt-injection, and a built-in rule set ships out of the box (fail-open, never a hard dependency).
- 🎛️ **Your models, your budget.** 12 providers, routable per role (plan on Opus, summarise on Haiku). Set a dollar + wall-clock + tool-call cap the kernel refuses to exceed — no surprise bills.
- 💻 **Runs anywhere.** Desktop app, one-line script, Docker, VPS, or a phone companion across 12 channels. MIT-licensed, no telemetry, no paid tier.

```bash
pipx install 'maverick-agent[installer]'
maverick init                        # four questions, safe defaults
maverick start "Research the top 3 CRMs for a 5-person startup and write a recommendation"
```

Prefer no terminal? Grab the [**double-click desktop installer**](#install). New here? See [`docs/getting-started.md`](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Status

Alpha, but **installable today**: all six packages are on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/maverick-agent/), the one-line installers work on Windows/macOS/Linux, and a native double-click installer builds for all three. See [`docs/getting-started.md`](./docs/getting-started.md) for the full flow.

## What works today vs. planned

| Component | v0.1 (today) | Planned (v0.2+) |
|---|---|---|
| Install | **Native installer (`.exe` / `.dmg` / `.AppImage`)**, one-line bootstrap (`install.ps1` / `install.sh`), pipx, or from source | Code-signed bundles + auto-update |
| GUI | Native installer app + local web dashboard (`maverick dashboard`) + chat at `/chat` | Native Tauri shell for the agent itself + iOS/Android |
| Sandbox | Local subprocess, Docker, SSH, Podman, devcontainer, Firecracker, Kubernetes | Modal, Daytona |
| AI providers | Anthropic (full), OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Gemini, DeepSeek, Bedrock, Azure, xAI, Moonshot, TGI, vLLM (per-role routable) | Cohere |
| Channels | Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, Email, Matrix, Bluesky, Mastodon (ready); WhatsApp, SMS, iMessage (scaffolds) | Push notifications, voice |
| Safety | Shield wired at 3 chokepoints; agent-shield SDK if installed, else a built-in rule set | Agent-shield full ~115 patterns |
| Distribution | PyPI (6 packages), GHCR image, PyInstaller binaries, **native installers on Releases** | Code signing; Homebrew tap |
| Tests | 2000+ tests, ruff + pytest on Py 3.10/3.11/3.12 | Integration suite + benchmark RESULTS.md |

## Install

### Download the app — no terminal needed (easiest)

Grab the installer for your OS from the **[latest release ›](https://github.com/cdayAI/Maverick/releases/latest)**, double-click it, then press **Install Maverick**:

| OS | File on the release |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Maverick_*_x64-setup.exe` |
| **macOS** | `Maverick_*_aarch64.dmg` |
| **Linux** | `Maverick_*_amd64.AppImage` |

It's unsigned for now, so the first launch shows an "unknown developer" prompt — on Windows click **More info → Run anyway**; on macOS right-click the app → **Open**. The app installs Python and Maverick for you, then you're set.

### Terminal install with pipx

If you already have Python 3.10+, install the published package instead of running a remote bootstrap script:

```bash
pipx install 'maverick-agent[installer]'
maverick init
```

For source-based desktop bootstrapping, download `deploy/desktop/install.sh` or `deploy/desktop/install.ps1` from a commit or release you trust, verify it, and set `MAVERICK_REF` to a full 40-character commit SHA. The bootstrap scripts intentionally reject mutable branch/tag refs by default.

The PyPI distribution name is `maverick-agent` (the `maverick` name is squatted on PyPI). The `[installer]` extra pulls the wizard into the same pipx environment so `maverick init` resolves.

If you already installed the kernel without the extra, inject the wizard:

```bash
pipx inject maverick-agent maverick-installer
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdayAI/maverick
cd maverick
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-core
pip install -e ./apps/installer-cli
# Optional sister packages:
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-shield
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-channels
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-dashboard
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-mcp

maverick init                           # interactive wizard
maverick start "Plan a 2-week trip"      # one-shot goal
maverick chat                            # interactive REPL
maverick dashboard                       # web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8765
maverick serve                           # channel server (Telegram/Discord/...)
maverick mcp                             # MCP server (Claude Code / Cursor)
maverick doctor                          # health check
maverick version                         # installed package versions
```

## Drive Maverick from another language

Maverick's kernel is Python, but its **wire surface** is the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Any
MCP-speaking language can drive the swarm from outside Python:

- **TypeScript / JavaScript** → [docs/clients/typescript-quickstart.md](./docs/clients/typescript-quickstart.md)
- **Go** → [docs/clients/go-quickstart.md](./docs/clients/go-quickstart.md)
- **Rust** → [docs/clients/rust-quickstart.md](./docs/clients/rust-quickstart.md)
- **C# / .NET** → [docs/clients/csharp-quickstart.md](./docs/clients/csharp-quickstart.md)
- **Java / JVM** → [docs/clients/java-quickstart.md](./docs/clients/java-quickstart.md)

Each is a 20-line program: spawn `maverick mcp`, list tools, call one.
Why this and not a separate `@maverick/core` port?

## Run Maverick in CI

Run the swarm inside any repo's GitHub Actions — on a PR, a schedule, or on
demand — under a hard spend cap:

```yaml
- uses: cdayAI/maverick/deploy/github-action@v0.1.6
  with:
    goal: "Summarize this PR and flag anything risky."
    max-dollars: "0.50"
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

See [docs/github-action.md](./docs/github-action.md).

## Vision

| Axis | Maverick |
|---|---|
| **Target user** | General consumer -- no AI expertise required |
| **Wedge** | Long-horizon depth + true multi-agent coordination |
| **Safety** | First-class. Every input, tool call, and output passes through Agent Shield. |
| **Control** | You pick the models. Per-role. Multi-provider. |
| **Deploy** | Desktop / Docker / VPS / Phone (12 channels) |
| **Privacy** | All detection runs locally. Your data never leaves your machine unless you choose a cloud LLM. |
