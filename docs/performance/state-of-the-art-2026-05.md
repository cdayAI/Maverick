# State-of-the-art review — May 2026

A frontier-readiness audit of the Maverick agent kernel, with a prioritized,
acquisition-oriented backlog. The goal is honesty: what is already
world-class, what is genuinely behind the 2026 frontier, and where the
highest-leverage moves are.

This doc is a strategic frame, not a contract. The first two items in
"Shipped in this pass" landed with tests; the rest is backlog.

## Verdict

Maverick is a **near-frontier** long-horizon agent kernel. It is not a
prototype: ~95k LOC across six packages, ~1,900 passing tests, a 36-month
roadmap, and a "council" review discipline visible throughout the git
history. Several subsystems are genuinely ahead of most shipping agent
frameworks.

### Already world-class

- **LLM layer (`providers/anthropic_provider.py`).** Three-breakpoint
  prompt caching (system + tool catalog + last stable turn) with
  per-model-family token minimums, byte-stable tool ordering to avoid
  silent cache busts, adaptive-vs-legacy extended-thinking gating that
  correctly handles Opus 4.7's adaptive-only constraint, per-block
  thinking-signature preservation across interleaved turns, and best-of-N
  temperature diversity wired end-to-end.
- **Agent loop (`agent.py`).** Test-driven verification on the
  orchestrator's FINAL, defensive patch validation (grader-fatal-path
  detection), SEARCH/REPLACE editing applied in disposable git worktrees,
  nonce-framed tool output (prompt-injection hardening), and killswitch +
  budget gates at every turn and tool boundary.
- **Breadth.** 12 providers (per-role routable), 11 channels, 7 sandbox
  backends, ~150 tools, an MCP client + server, and a safety shield wired
  at three chokepoints — fail-open, never a hard dependency.

## The real gaps (ranked by leverage)

### 1. No published benchmark numbers — the single biggest credibility gap

`benchmarks/RESULTS.md` contains one dry-run row. The harness
(`benchmarks/swe_bench.py`, `harness.py`) is real and runnable, but there
are **zero** live SWE-bench Verified / SWE-bench Pro / GAIA / τ-bench
results. This is the first question any acquirer or skeptic asks, and the
positioning ("performs at the level of OpenClaw/Hermes") is currently
unbacked.

The fix is not code; it is **spend + discipline**. Run SWE-bench Verified
end-to-end on a tagged release, commit the rows, and gate regressions in
CI against a stored baseline. Fabricated numbers are the one thing that
would actively destroy credibility, so the harness here was hardened and
the pipeline made reproducible rather than faking a result.

### 2. ~2,000 lines of unwired frontier-reasoning shelfware

`reflexion.py`, `prm.py` (process reward model), `tree_of_thought.py`, and
`debate.py` were imported **nowhere** outside their own tests. The
capability was built but never connected to the live loop — pure
aspiration. **All four are now wired** (opt-in, off by default):
`reflexion` (failed runs teach the next), `tree_of_thought` (planning
pre-pass), `debate` (best-of-N tie-breaker), and `prm` (per-step scoring
with early abandonment) — see below. This gap is closed.

### 3. Serial tool execution within a turn

The loop executed parallel tool calls one at a time. Frontier harnesses run
independent calls concurrently — the dominant SWE-bench localization
pattern is "read these 5 files," which was paying N× the latency it should.
(Fixed in this pass; see below.)

### 4. The moat is real but unmeasured

The genuinely differentiated angle vs. OpenAI/Google is the **persistent
world model + skill auto-distillation**: an agent that *compounds* across
runs. This exists (`world_model.py`, `skills.py`, `reflexion.py`) but is
opt-in, off by default, and has no metric proving it improves the next run.
Make "second attempt at a similar task is measurably better/cheaper" a
first-class, demoable benchmark and it becomes the headline.

## Shipped in this pass (with tests)

### Learning-loop hardening (the moat, made trustworthy)

The "moat" — skills distilled from past runs and recalled into future ones
— was an open loop: any "success" wrote a skill, retrieval was raw keyword
overlap, and nothing tracked whether a skill ever actually helped. Three
changes close it into a self-curating system:

- **Quality gate.** `distill()` skips writing (before the paid distiller
  call) when the run's verifier confidence is below
  `MAVERICK_DISTILL_MIN_CONFIDENCE` (default 0.75), so a low-confidence
  "success" can't become a standing instruction in every future run. The
  accepted confidence is stamped into the skill frontmatter as provenance.
- **Quality-weighted retrieval.** `quality_weight()` re-ranks recall by
  that provenance, applied to both the embedding cosine and the lexical
  trigger score — relevance still dominates; a low-confidence skill yields
  to an equally-relevant higher-confidence one but is never silenced.
- **Usage tracking + decay** (`skill_stats.py`). Every recall records a
  use; each run's outcome is attributed to the skills it used. A skill
  that keeps riding along with failures decays in rank
  (`floor + (1-floor)·win_rate` after a fair trial) and chronic losers are
  flagged `evictable()`. Disable with `MAVERICK_SKILL_DECAY=0`.

Covered by `tests/test_distill_quality_gate.py`,
`tests/test_skill_quality_ranking.py`, `tests/test_skill_stats.py`, and
`tests/test_skill_decay_integration.py`.

### Concurrent tool execution

When a single model turn emits 2+ tool calls and **every** one is
`parallel_safe`, the loop now runs them with `asyncio.gather` instead of
awaiting each in sequence. `parallel_safe` is a new, conservative
opt-in flag on `Tool` (default `False`); only pure, idempotent reads carry
it (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `repo_map`, `dep_graph`). A turn containing any
stateful tool (shell, write, spawn, `ask_user`, a rate-limited network
tool) falls back to the serial path, so side-effect ordering and the
block-on-user semantics are unchanged. Toggle with
`MAVERICK_PARALLEL_TOOLS=0`. Covered by `tests/test_parallel_tools.py`.

### Reflexion learning loop, wired in

`reflexion.py` is now connected to `orchestrator.run_goal`: on a failed run
it records a deterministic postmortem (no extra LLM spend on the
already-failing path), and on the next similar goal it recalls and injects
those lessons into the orchestrator brief. Off by default; enable with
`MAVERICK_REFLEXION=1` or `[reflexion] enable = true`. Covered by
`tests/test_reflexion_wiring.py`.

### Tree-of-thought planning, wired in

`tree_of_thought.py` was imported nowhere. It is now an opt-in planning
pre-pass in `run_goal`: with `[planning] mode = "tree_of_thought"` (or
`MAVERICK_PLANNING=tree_of_thought`), the orchestrator forks N candidate
plans, scores them with a critic, and prepends the winning plan to its
brief. The synchronous planner runs in a worker thread so its N+1 calls
don't block the event loop. Off by default (`mode = "single"`). Adds
`config.get_planning()`. Covered by `tests/test_tot_wiring.py`.

### Debate tie-break in best-of-N selection

`debate.py` was imported nowhere. It is now an opt-in tie-breaker in
`run_goal_best_of_n`: when the top candidates are tied on score (exactly
where the heuristic selector is weakest), two sub-agents argue which patch
is the better fix and a judge picks the winner, overriding the heuristic.
Bounded (top-3 tied candidates, one round, on a slice of remaining
budget) and best-effort (a draw or any failure keeps the heuristic pick).
Off by default; enable with `MAVERICK_BON_DEBATE=1`. Covered by
`tests/test_debate_tiebreak.py`.

### Self-consistency voting in best-of-N selection

`select_best_candidate` previously broke all-zero-score ties (the common
case when no ground-truth tests are available) by preferring the
last/largest attempt. It now applies majority voting first: among N
independent rollouts, the patch whose changed-file set agrees with the
plurality of other attempts is preferred over a lone outlier. It is a
strict refinement — when every attempt touches a distinct file set the
prior ordering is unchanged. Off-switch: `MAVERICK_BON_CONSENSUS=0`.
Covered by `tests/test_bon_consensus.py`.

### Process reward model, wired in

`prm.py` was the last unwired primitive. It is now an opt-in per-step
scorer in the `Agent` loop: each step is scored for promise/progress, and
a trajectory whose trailing-window promise stays below a floor is
abandoned before it burns the whole budget (the AgentPRM
compute-efficiency win). Default backend is `NullPRM` — scoring is skipped
entirely and the loop is unchanged. Activate with
`MAVERICK_PRM=heuristic|remote`; tune with `MAVERICK_PRM_WINDOW` /
`MAVERICK_PRM_FLOOR`. Covered by `tests/test_prm_wiring.py`.

### Compounding-moat benchmark

`benchmarks/moat.py` makes Maverick's core differentiator *measurable*:
it runs each task pair cold (fresh world model, learning off — the
stateless baseline) then warm (same world model, learning on) and reports
the cost / tool-call / wall deltas plus cold-vs-warm success rates. A moat
is "demonstrated" only when the warm phase is cheaper **and** no less
reliable. The measurement logic takes an injected runner, so it is fully
unit-tested offline (`benchmarks/test_moat.py`); a real run needs an API
key. Per this audit's own standard, `MOAT_RESULTS.md` is not committed
with placeholder numbers.

### Thread-offloaded concurrency for sync tool reads

The agent loop already gathers a turn's `parallel_safe` calls
concurrently, but sync tool functions (network/file reads) ran
back-to-back on the event loop, so the gather bought them nothing.
`ToolRegistry.run` now offloads non-coroutine tool fns via
`asyncio.to_thread`, so concurrently-gathered sync reads truly overlap.
The idempotent network read tools — `http_fetch`, `arxiv`, `wikipedia`,
`semantic_scholar`, `hackernews` — are now `parallel_safe` and join that
path. Off-switch: `MAVERICK_TOOL_THREAD_OFFLOAD=0`. Covered by
`tests/test_parallel_net_tools.py`.

### Speculative-execution primitive + speculative finalization

`maverick/speculative.py` is a small reusable primitive: `speculate(coro)`
starts a coroutine eagerly and returns a handle to `await result()` or
`cancel()` later, and `run_independent(*coros)` fans out best-effort side
effects without one failure aborting the others. `run_goal` uses it to run
the post-FINAL trajectory-donation and conversation-turn writes as
background threads that overlap with skill distillation, then joins them
before returning. Off-switch: `MAVERICK_SPECULATIVE_FINALIZE=0`. Covered by
`tests/test_speculative.py` and `tests/test_speculative_finalize.py`.

This primitive is deliberately the foundation for **true streaming
speculative verification** (the literal backlog item 10): the eventual
implementation does `spec = speculate(verify_final(...))` the instant a
FINAL marker is seen mid-stream, keeps generating, then `await
spec.result()` — hiding the verifier round-trip behind the generation
tail. That step is deferred because it requires adding streaming to
`complete_async` and detecting the marker inside the thinking-block /
tool_use replay logic in `agent.py` — the kernel's most fragile,
hard-won code — and should land only when it can be benchmark-validated
against regressions (gated on backlog item 5's spend discipline).

## Backlog (highest leverage first)

Items 6 (wire the reasoning modules), 7 (measure the moat), 9 (parallelise
network reads), and the *foundation* for 10 (speculative-execution
primitive + speculative finalization) are done — see "Shipped in this
pass." Remaining:

5. **Publish SWE-bench Verified numbers** on a tagged release; add a CI
   regression gate against a committed baseline (item 1). Now the #1 gap.
8. **Run the moat benchmark for real** and commit `MOAT_RESULTS.md` from a
   keyed run, so the differentiator has published figures (depends on #5's
   spend discipline).
10b. **True streaming speculative verification.** Stream `complete_async`,
   detect the FINAL marker mid-generation, and `speculate(verify_final(...))`
   so the verifier overlaps the generation tail. Builds on
   `maverick/speculative.py`; deferred until benchmark-validatable (see the
   speculative-finalization note above).
