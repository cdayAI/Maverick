# Design Spec: MCP Elicitation → Shield/Consent

**Status:** Draft / proposal · **Roadmap ref:** [`ROADMAP-ADDITIONS.md`](../ROADMAP-ADDITIONS.md) §B1 ([#396](https://github.com/cdayAI/Maverick/issues/396)) · **Date:** May 2026

> Proposal for discussion. Stops at interface + integration points; module
> names/handlers should be confirmed against current code at implementation time.

## 1. Problem

MCP **elicitation** lets an MCP **server** request structured input from the
user *mid-request*, routed through the client. Maverick's MCP server
(`packages/maverick-mcp/maverick_mcp/server.py`) deliberately **does not advertise
the elicitation capability** today — the `handle_initialize` capabilities block
omits it on purpose, with a comment that advertising it without a handler would
make 2025-11-25 clients hang waiting on a request that never comes. Instead, the
server relies on the `ask_user` tool for human-in-the-loop.

Two gaps result:
1. **As a server**, Maverick can't use the protocol-native input channel; clients
   (Claude Desktop, Cursor) that support elicitation render a poorer experience
   (a tool round-trip instead of a typed form).
2. **As a client** consuming *external* MCP servers (`mcp_client.py`), Maverick
   does **not** handle incoming `elicitation/create` requests at all — a server
   that elicits gets no response, stalling the call.

The high-value framing: elicitation is the protocol-native **human-in-the-loop /
consent** channel, and Maverick already has a consent substrate
(`safety/consent.py`, the `approvals` table + dashboard `/approvals`, the
`ask_user` → `questions` flow). Wiring elicitation through that substrate — with
the **shield** screening elicited content — is the right design.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- G1. **Server side**: advertise + implement elicitation so `ask_user`-style
  prompts surface as protocol forms when the client supports it (fall back to the
  `ask_user` tool when it doesn't — capability-gated).
- G2. **Client side**: handle inbound `elicitation/create` from external MCP
  servers by routing to the same consent/approval UI a tool call would use.
- G3. **Shield-screened**: elicited prompts (server→user) and elicited responses
  (user→server) pass through the shield; the URL-mode rules are enforced.
- G4. **Secrets never transit the model**: support elicitation **URL mode** for
  sensitive flows (OAuth/API keys/payments) so credentials go user↔service
  directly, never through the LLM context.

**Non-goals**
- N1. Replacing `ask_user`/`questions` — elicitation is an *additional*,
  capability-gated surface over the same backing store, not a rewrite.
- N2. Full remote-server OAuth (that's §B2 — but URL-mode elicitation is a
  prerequisite-friendly building block for it).

## 3. The two directions

### 3a. Maverick as MCP **server** (outbound elicitation)
When a tool/flow needs user input and the connected client advertised
`elicitation` at initialize:
1. Emit `elicitation/create` with a JSON-Schema-typed `requestedSchema` (form
   mode) or a `url` (URL mode).
2. **Shield-screen the prompt** before sending (it's model-influenced text going
   to the user).
3. Persist the pending request in the existing `questions`/`approvals` store so
   the dashboard and other channels stay consistent and it survives a restart.
4. On the client's response, **shield-screen the returned content**, then resume
   the tool. Honor the three elicitation outcomes: `accept` / `decline` /
   `cancel` (decline ≠ cancel — cancel aborts, decline continues without the
   value).
5. **Capability gate**: only advertise + use elicitation when the client declared
   it; otherwise fall back to the `ask_user` tool exactly as today. (This closes
   the "clients hang" hazard the current code comment calls out.)

### 3b. Maverick as MCP **client** (inbound elicitation)
`mcp_client.py` must handle `elicitation/create` from external servers:
1. Validate the request; enforce **URL-mode rules** — MUST show the full URL,
   MUST NOT pre-fetch it, MUST NOT auto-open it.
2. Route the prompt through the **consent/approval** path (`safety/consent.py` +
   the `approvals` queue), not straight to the LLM — an external server asking
   for input is a trust-boundary event, and the user (or policy) decides.
3. Shield-screen both the server's prompt and the user's response.
4. Return `accept`/`decline`/`cancel` per the user/policy decision; never
   pass-through credentials into model context.

## 4. Integration points (confirm names at impl time)
- `server.py::handle_initialize` — advertise `elicitation` *only* once a handler
  exists; add the send/await path.
- `mcp_client.py` — add an `elicitation/create` request handler (it currently has
  none).
- `safety/consent.py` + `approvals` table + dashboard `/approvals` — the shared
  consent surface both directions route through.
- `tools/ask_user.py` + `questions` — backing store; elicitation is a richer
  transport over the same records.
- Shield (`scan_input`/`scan_output`) — screen elicited prompts + responses.

## 5. Hard parts
- **Capability negotiation**: never send elicitation to a client that didn't
  advertise it (the existing hazard). Gate on the initialize result.
- **URL-mode safety**: the "show full URL, no pre-fetch, no auto-open" rules are a
  shield/consent concern; encode them as hard checks, not guidance.
- **Statelessness/resume**: an elicitation can outlive a transport reconnect;
  persist pending requests (ties into the durable-execution work — a run blocked
  on elicitation is `awaiting_user`).
- **Decline vs cancel semantics**: map cleanly onto the consent outcomes so a
  decline doesn't abort a long run.

## 6. Phasing
- **Phase 1 — client inbound handler.** Handle `elicitation/create` from external
  servers via the consent queue (form mode). Smallest slice; unblocks servers
  that elicit, which otherwise stall.
- **Phase 2 — server outbound (form mode).** Advertise + emit elicitation,
  capability-gated, backed by `questions`/`approvals`, shield-screened.
- **Phase 3 — URL mode** both directions (the secrets-never-transit-model path);
  dovetails with §B2 remote-server OAuth.

## 7. Test plan
- Client: an external server emits `elicitation/create`; assert it surfaces in the
  approvals queue, the shield screens it, and accept/decline/cancel are returned
  correctly; URL-mode request is shown-but-not-fetched/opened.
- Server: with an elicitation-capable client, `ask_user` surfaces as a form and
  resumes on response; with a non-capable client, it falls back to the `ask_user`
  tool (no hang).
- Shield: a malicious elicited prompt/response is screened on both legs.

## 8. Open questions
1. Should inbound elicitation default to **auto-decline** under the strict safety
   profile (server can't prompt the user without explicit opt-in)?
2. Do non-interactive deployments (channel/headless) answer elicitation from
   policy/config, or always decline?
3. One unified consent record type for tool-consent + elicitation, or separate?
