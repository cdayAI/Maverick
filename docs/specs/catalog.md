# Maverick content catalog (federated)

A catalog lets users browse and install community content — skills
today, plugins / MCP servers / personas next — without editing config
or running install-by-URL. It's the dashboard **Store** tab and the
`maverick skill browse` / `maverick skill add` commands.

## Index format

One `index.json` per kind, served at `<base>/<kind>/index.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "skills",
  "entries": [
    {
      "name": "summarize-url",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "summary": "Fetch a URL and write a 3-sentence summary.",
      "source": "gh:org/repo:path/to/SKILL.md",
      "sha256": "<hex digest of the fetched content>",
      "author": "org",
      "verified": true,
      "install_count": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

A worked example lives in [`catalog-example/`](./catalog-example/).

## Trust model

The catalog is **curated + hash-pinned**, which is what lets a consumer
click "Install" without the `MAVERICK_ALLOW_SKILL_INSTALL` opt-in that
free-text URL installs require:

1. **Curated** — an entry only exists because someone opened a PR
   against the index (the `awesome-maverick` repo). That's the same
   review bar as a package registry.
2. **Hash-pinned** — on install, the client fetches `source`, computes
   the SHA-256, and refuses to write if it doesn't match the index's
   `sha256`. A compromised mirror can't swap the bytes.
3. **Shield-scanned** — the skill body still passes through Agent
   Shield before it's written (same as every install path), so a
   prompt-injection payload in a curated skill is still caught.

Free-text `POST /api/v1/skills` (arbitrary `gh:`/`https:` source) stays
gated behind `MAVERICK_ALLOW_SKILL_INSTALL=1` — that's the RCE vector.
`POST /api/v1/catalog/skills/install` (resolve-by-name, hash-verified)
does not.

## Configuration

```toml
[catalogs]
# Base URLs (no trailing /kind). Multiple indexes merge; earlier wins
# on name collision. Defaults to the awesome-maverick index.
indexes = ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/your-index/main/catalog"]
```

Self-hosting an index is just serving static `index.json` files — a
GitHub Pages repo or any HTTPS static host. No server code required.

## Caching

Indexes cache to `~/.maverick/cache/catalog/` for 6 hours. An
unreachable index degrades to "no entries" (it never breaks the
dashboard) and serves a stale cache if one exists.

## Surfaces

- Dashboard: `/store` (Store tab) + `GET /api/v1/catalog/{kind}` +
  `POST /api/v1/catalog/skills/install`
- CLI: `maverick skill browse`, `maverick skill add <name>`

## Roadmap

- Plugins / MCP / personas install-from-catalog (schema already
  supports the kinds; only skills wire the install path today)
- Ed25519 publisher signatures + a `verified` badge driven by the
  signing key, not a hand-set bool
- Privacy-respecting install counts (anonymous increment)
