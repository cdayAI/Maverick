"""Shield fallback / built-in rules / verdict factory tests.

Note: as of v0.1.3 Shield is NOT a no-op when agent-shield SDK is
missing -- it falls back to built-in rules (~20 high-impact patterns).
Tests below verify the built-in path catches attacks, lets benign
inputs through, and that `backend="none"` is the explicit kill switch.
