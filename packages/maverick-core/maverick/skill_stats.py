"""Skill usage tracking + decay.

The quality gate (distill-time) and quality weighting (distilled_confidence)
judge a skill by the run that CREATED it. This module judges a skill by how
it PERFORMS once in circulation: every time a skill is recalled into a run
we record a use, and when that run finishes we record the outcome against
the skills it used. A skill that's repeatedly recalled but rides along with
failures loses rank (decay); one that rarely helps and never wins can be
evicted. This closes the learning loop — the library curates itself instead
of only growing.

Storage: ``~/.maverick/skill_stats.json`` (chmod 600), a flat map of
``name -> {uses, wins, losses, last_used}``. Reads/writes go through a
process lock and are fully fail-safe — stats are an optimization, never a
correctness dependency, so any I/O error degrades to "no signal" (neutral
weight) and never blocks a run.

All recording is opt-in-friendly: disable the decay multiplier with
``MAVERICK_SKILL_DECAY=0`` and ranking falls back to relevance × distilled
confidence only.
