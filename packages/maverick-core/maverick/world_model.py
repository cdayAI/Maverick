"""Persistent world model. SQLite with FTS5 + per-connection WAL.

v0.1.6 reliability hardening:
  - PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL so the agent process (writer) and dashboard
    process (reader) don't deadlock on each other.
  - PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000 so concurrent commits retry briefly
    instead of raising OperationalError.
  - check_same_thread=False so FastAPI's threadpool can share the connection.
  - Indexes on goals(status) and goals(updated_at) for the dashboard's
    `list goals by status` and `active_goal()` queries.
