"""Verifier role: independent second-opinion pass on a proposer's answer.

Karpathy SOTA-review prescription: the recursive multi-agent ceremony
only earns its complexity if there's a real verify step. The current
``revisor`` role exists in prompt strings only -- no code actually runs
a verifier pass before declaring FINAL.

This module gives the orchestrator a single function to call:

    verdict = await verify_proposal(brief, proposal, llm, budget)

The verifier is invoked with a different system prompt + a fresh
budget allocation so its output isn't anchored by the proposer's
context. The verdict is structured:

    verdict.confidence:   float in [0, 1]
    verdict.accepts:      bool (confidence >= threshold)
    verdict.critique:     str (always populated; empty string if accepts)
    verdict.issues:       list[str] (specific problems flagged)

The agent loop uses `accepts` to early-stop, and feeds `critique` back
to the proposer as a revision brief if it doesn't accept. `confidence`
is the disagreement signal that adaptive fanout reads (see
``maverick.tools.spawn``).

You have access to no tools. Your job is to read the brief + the proposed final answer and decide:
1. Does the answer actually satisfy the brief? Be strict.
2. Are there factual errors, missing steps, or unsupported claims?
3. Would a careful human accept this?

Respond with a JSON object on a single line:

{"confidence": 0.0-1.0, "accepts": true|false, "critique": "<1-2 sentences>", "issues": ["<short issue>", ...]}

Confidence calibration:
- 0.9-1.0: The answer fully satisfies the brief, no meaningful issues.
- 0.7-0.9: Mostly correct; minor polish would help but it's defensible.
- 0.4-0.7: Significant gaps; a careful reviewer would want revisions.
- 0.0-0.4: Wrong direction or unsupported; reject.

`accepts` should be true iff confidence >= 0.75 AND issues is empty (or only nitpicks).
Output ONLY the JSON. No preamble, no markdown fence.
