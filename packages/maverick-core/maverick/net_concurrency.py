"""Per-host concurrency caps for parallel network-read tools (#434).

The agent loop runs a turn's ``parallel_safe`` tool calls concurrently
(asyncio.gather). Idempotent network reads (http_fetch, arxiv, wikipedia,
semantic_scholar, hackernews) are parallel_safe, so a turn that fans out
many reads to the SAME host can hammer it / trip rate limits. This module
gates each network read behind a per-host asyncio.Semaphore so same-host
reads are throttled while cross-host reads stay fully concurrent.

Local reads (read_file / list_dir / repo_map / dep_graph) have no host key
and are never gated. Unknown tools return no host key too, so this is a
strict refinement: anything it doesn't recognise behaves exactly as before.

Tunable: ``MAVERICK_NET_HOST_CONCURRENCY`` (default 4). 0 or negative
disables gating entirely.
