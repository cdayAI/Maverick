"""Audit log for Maverick.

Append-only NDJSON sink at ``~/.maverick/audit/YYYY-MM-DD.ndjson``.
Daily rotation. Each line is a versioned JSON event.

Event types (see ``events.py``):
  - goal_start / goal_end       — goal lifecycle
  - episode_start / episode_end — best-of-N attempt lifecycle
  - tool_call / tool_result     — every tool invocation
  - shield_block                — Shield denied an input/output/tool call
  - consent_prompt / consent_result — destructive-action gates
  - secret_redacted             — secret detector hit
  - erase                       — GDPR Art.17 erasure
  - halt                        — killswitch fired

This module is intentionally minimal. The writer is fail-safe: if
something goes wrong inside the audit path, we log a warning and keep
the agent running. Audit failures should NEVER crash the swarm.
