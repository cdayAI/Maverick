"""Audit-log erase coverage extension.

GDPR Art. 17 right-to-erasure already covers world-model state via
``maverick erase --channel X --user Y``. This module extends that to
the audit log: scrub or tombstone audit events tied to the same user
identity.

Two modes:

  - ``scrub_user(channel, user_id)``: rewrites matching lines to a
    tombstone form, preserving the row count and timestamps but
    removing identifying payload fields. Default behavior.
  - ``delete_user(channel, user_id)``: removes matching lines entirely.
    More aggressive; use when you need the audit log to look like the
    user never existed.

Both walk every `*.ndjson` file in ``~/.maverick/audit/``. They never
modify files mid-write — they write to a temp file and atomically
rename.

Matching: an event matches a user iff its payload contains
``channel`` AND ``user_id`` keys equal to the args (or
``channel:user_id`` appears in any string field).
