"""`diagnose` reports coding-language toolchains (polyglot operator UX).

Maverick can now build/test Rust/Go/TS, but only the `local` sandbox uses the
host toolchain -- container backends get it from their image. diagnose surfaces
which toolchains are reachable and which backend supplies them, so an operator
setting up polyglot can see what's missing.
