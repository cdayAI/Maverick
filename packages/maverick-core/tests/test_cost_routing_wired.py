"""Cost-aware routing is wired into model_for_role (the single chokepoint
every Agent uses to resolve its model).

Before this, cost_router.pick() existed but nothing called it from the live
path -- enabling MAVERICK_COST_ROUTING did nothing. These tests pin that:
  - off by default: behaviour unchanged (ROLE_MODELS defaults win)
  - explicit user choice (env override / config) always wins over the router
  - when opted in with a cheap provider configured, cheap roles route to it
  - the router never picks below a role's tier (orchestrator stays premium)
