"""A budget/wall-clock exhaustion must give the helpful 'raise the cap'
message, not a generic 'ran into an error'.

The agent swallows BudgetExceeded into result.error (so spawned children
return gracefully), which meant the orchestrator's nice budget message was
unreachable for the common case -- the user saw a generic error with no hint
to raise --max-dollars.
