"""End-to-end orchestrator test: drive run_goal() with a scripted FakeLLM.

This is the highest-level test in the kernel — proves that:
  - the recursive agent loop, blackboard, world model, budget, sandbox,
    skill distill, and episode bookkeeping all integrate cleanly
  - the orchestrator persists goal status transitions correctly
    (pending -> active -> done / blocked)
  - blackboard posts mirror into `goal_events` so the dashboard can stream

The council called out that we had unit tests for every component but
nothing exercised the wire connecting them.
