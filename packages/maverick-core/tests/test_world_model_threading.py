"""Council round-2 perf-seat regression: WorldModel write serialisation.

PR #98 introduced a per-DB-path WorldModel singleton in the dashboard
so requests stopped reopening SQLite + reapplying migrations. That's
the right call for perf, but ``check_same_thread=False`` alone is not
thread-safe: two FastAPI threadpool workers driving execute()+commit()
on the same connection can interleave their writes so one transaction
silently includes the other's row. Worst case: thread A errors and
rolls back, thread B's "successful" insert vanishes.

The ``_writing()`` context manager + RLock added in this PR make every
mutating method commit exactly one logical write. These tests prove
it under load.
